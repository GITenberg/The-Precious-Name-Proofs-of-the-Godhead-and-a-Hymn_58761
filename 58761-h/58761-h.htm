PRECIOUS NAME<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF</span><br />
JESUS. <a name="citation1"></a><a href="#footnote1"
class="citation">[1]</a></h2>
<p><span class="smcap">The</span> adorable Redeemer is stiled
Jehovah 330 times in the Old Testament&mdash;he is called God 90
times in the Old Testament&mdash;he is called God 25 times in the
New&mdash;he is called the Son of God 41 times&mdash;he is called
the Son of man 60 times&mdash;he is glorious in holiness, in all
his works and ways, and independently possesses an essential
glory as God, equal with the Father, an ever blessed Spirit, a
glory as the Son of God, a personal glory as God-man, a
mediatorial glory in the work of redemption, a relative glory as
the great and only head of the Church, a declarative glory in all
his works of Creation, <a name="page2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>Grace, and Providence; there is no end
of his greatness to them only which believe he is
gracious&mdash;his name is as ointment poured forth.&nbsp; There
is one blessed effect which the Name of Jesus has upon the mind
and conduct of believers, worthy of attention, and that is
<i>reverence</i>.&nbsp; The Names of Jesus being precious,
lovely, and blessed, are had in particular reverence by all them
that fear him.&nbsp; Hence we are said to serve God acceptably,
with reverence, and godly fear&mdash;that reverence which God
approves, himself produces; and this reverence is necessary in
the use of his Names&mdash;in the godly conversation of saints,
and in the public ordinances of his appointment.&nbsp; The first
instance is the mark I aim at&mdash;to treat the subject
according to its importance would fill a volume.&nbsp; What
Christian to whom this Name is dear, but must lament the abuse of
it among the carnal and ungodly people of the
world&mdash;&ldquo;Surely, because of swearing, the land
mourneth.&rdquo;&nbsp; What horrid oaths, what dreadful
imprecations, what loud and repeated calls on God, on Christ, to
blast the members and faculties of soul and body, although God
has given many a public signal of his disapprobation of such
conduct, by answering their prayers in a moment, and suddenly
driving them to destruction and perdition&mdash;O! you that once
were slaves to such an infernal custom, but now called out of
darkness into light&mdash;what are your feelings when you hear
this best of Names blasphemed?&nbsp; When you call to remembrance
your past conduct, surely you can exclaim, &ldquo;by the grace of
God I am what I am.&rdquo;&nbsp; What humility, contrition, and
godly sorrow do you feel, upon every renewed sense of past <a
name="page3"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 3</span>folly&mdash;and
what gratitude do you feel to him who hath made you to
differ.&nbsp; And to endear that Name to you now, which was once
profaned by you, (but leaving the world of the ungodly) I must
come nearer home, even to those who profess better things; and
bear my testimony against the prevalent folly of many
professors.&nbsp; There appears an inseparable connection between
love and fear&mdash;I mean that holy, child-like, filial fear
that God has promised to give his children&mdash;&ldquo;I will
put my fear in their hearts:&rdquo;&mdash;this fear is of
especial service to the saints; and when in exercise they can
resist almost any temptation&mdash;witness Joseph&rsquo;s
conduct.&nbsp; When it is not in exercise, the believer is in
danger of falling into sin, or complying with the first
temptation that presents itself.&nbsp; This fear is only the
effect of spiritual knowledge, and the love of God, as reconciled
and well pleased with us.&mdash;While faith apprehends the love
of God, our love is led forth to him in sweet return; and is
attended with a holy spiritual awe&mdash;viewing the majesty of
his person, and the glory of his character, although the soul is
admitted into the most sweet familiarity with God.&mdash;When
this is the case the Name of Jesus is precious indeed; and when
this is not the state of the soul, there is a love, and a fear of
the dear, the dreadful name of the <span class="smcap">Lord thy
God</span>!&mdash;And surely such souls can never hear or read,
with pleasure, the pompous titles given to sinful men, as his
Holiness&mdash;which is an attribute of Deity&mdash;as, the Most,
or Right Reverend Father in God, Lord of such a place&mdash;or
even the common name given to ministers in general, as the
Reverend so and so&mdash;the term <a name="page4"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 4</span>Reverend, belongs to God alone, as
God&mdash;Holy and Reverend is his Name&mdash;and no one
beside.&nbsp; I wish great men, and good ministers, to have all
the respect paid them becoming their stations, but not at the
expence of the Divine honour.&mdash;Another part of this folly is
evident, from the light and trifling manner in which the Name of
God is used in the pulpit&mdash;as swearing by his life, which is
customary among some good ministers, and their hearers copy after
them&mdash;so that upon every trifling occasion, we hear the
dogmatical and awful oath pronounced, &ldquo;As God
liveth&mdash;as the Lord liveth,&rdquo; it is so and so; and,
perhaps, to an assertion that we have only their <i>ipse
dixit</i> for.&mdash;O ye ministers of the Lord Jesus&mdash;do
not use this term so frequent; for I do not think any one has a
right to swear by God&rsquo;s life but himself, who, because he
could swear by none greater sware by himself in the Covenant, to
be the God of his Church.&mdash;How prevalent is this profanity
among the professors of the day&mdash;when upon almost every
meeting, parting, and common conversation, they break out in this
unguarded and impious language&mdash;&ldquo;Good God!&mdash;Good
Lord!&mdash;Lord Jesus!&mdash;God bless you!&rdquo;&mdash;with
other expressions of the like kind.&mdash;What the excellent
Cowper observes, is worthy of remark, as it contains a sharp
reproof to worldlings, and profane professors.</p>
<blockquote><p>&nbsp;&nbsp;&nbsp;Oaths terminate, as Paul
observes, all strife;<br />
Some men have surely, then, a peaceful life,<br />
In every tale they tell, or false or true,<br />
Well known, or such as no man ever knew&mdash;<br />
They fix attention, heedless of your pain,<br />
With oaths, like rivets, forc&rsquo;d into your brain!</p>
<p><a name="page5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>A
Persian, humble servant of the Sun,<br />
(Who, tho&rsquo; devout, yet bigotry had none)<br />
Hearing a Lawyer, grave in his address,<br />
With adjurations, every word impress&mdash;<br />
Suppos&rsquo;d the man a Bishop! or at least,<br />
God&rsquo;s Name upon his lips&mdash;a Priest!<br />
Bow&rsquo;d at the close, with all his graceful airs,<br />
And begg&rsquo;d an interest in his fervent prayers!</p>
</blockquote>
<p><i>Only call to mind the third Commandment</i>!</p>
<p>This subject the libertine may treat with contempt, and say,
What have we to do with the law of commands&mdash;why it was only
made for carnal characters; they will be judged by it!&nbsp; But
surely the children of God, who love and esteem the Name of their
Father, God, their Saviour, Jesus, will not, must not, blaspheme
their Names.&mdash;Time would fail to mention all the ways by
which the Name of Jesus is slighted, in light conversation on
religious topics.&mdash;I wish to be understood here; I do not
mean that upon the Name of Jesus, people are to adopt the Popish
system of bowing the head or drop a curtsey, nor put on a
fearful, dismal gloom; but to speak of his Name, Person, and
Work, soberly, discreetly, yet affectionately; and upon their
separation from each other, to commend each to God, with a degree
of solemnity and christian affection&mdash;as
&ldquo;Farewell&mdash;Grace and Peace be with you&mdash;The Lord
be with you;&rdquo;&mdash;while the heart sweetly replies
&ldquo;and with thy spirit!&rdquo;</p>
<p>Reverence in prayer, I love and prize&mdash;access to God with
an holy boldness, but not impudence; nor a gloomy, horrid
countenance, as if we were addressing <a name="page6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>a God that hated us.&nbsp; How solemn
and how sweet the address of certain characters, to
Jesus&mdash;&ldquo;Lord save me!&mdash;Lord help me!&mdash;Lord
that I might receive my sight!&mdash;Lord Jesus receive my
spirit&rdquo;&mdash;Let the word of God be your rule in all
things&mdash;so in an attendance on the public means, be
reverent, be serious, be cheerful&mdash;in an early
attendance&mdash;let not your religion disturb the religion of
others&mdash;if late, do not rush into your seats, while the
minister is in prayer.&nbsp; How painful to hear the females come
in with pattens on&mdash;and others opening and shutting their
pews&mdash;some coughing and sneezing, so loud as to hurt the
feelings, and almost turn the temper of the most amiable
ministers in the world, to smother them.&mdash;Another species of
irreverence I have long noticed with grief, among many
dissenters&mdash;as soon as the last sentence of the Sermon is
pronounced, many directly rush out of Chapel, as though they were
glad it was over&mdash;in some cases it is excusable; a person
may be faint in a warm place&mdash;others, in service&mdash;some
obliged to hasten to their families; they may be excused.&mdash;I
wish every congregation showed as much reverence in the close of
service, as a certain place of worship I had the honour once to
preach in&mdash;none went out till the Benediction was
pronounced; and not till the whole assembly had stood still for
the space of one or two minutes: How lovely the sight!&nbsp; Do
ye, dissenters, adopt the same plan&mdash;it will show your love
to the Gospel of Jesus, and to his assemblies.&nbsp; I readily
grant that these things have nothing to do with our salvation;
but surely no believer will object to them, as they are designed
for the honour of that dear Name, in whom centers all our
felicity.</p>
<p><a name="page7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>I might
mention many other blessed effects which are produced by the Holy
Spirit&rsquo;s making this Name precious to believers; but I
forbear to enlarge on any other particulars&mdash;only the bare
mention of a few things&mdash;an humble reliance, trust, and
confidence in him&mdash;&ldquo;they that know thy Name will put
their trust in thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; Supreme love to his Person,
Works, Ways, Ministers, Truths, and
Dispensations&mdash;submission to his Will&mdash;a desire to be
conformed to his Image&mdash;to be like him&mdash;to enjoy much
communion with him&mdash;and to be for ever with him, in a state
of endless felicity.&mdash;These effects deaden us to the world,
mortify sin, lead us to deny all self-righteousness, keep us near
him, humble the soul, and create the most intense desire that
others may be made acquainted with this Name.&nbsp; This is our
refuge, our joy, our glory&mdash;&ldquo;the Name of the Lord is a
strong tower; the righteous runneth in and are safe.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Ye children of the most high God, this Jesus is yours, in the
most exalted sense of the word, if you are driven out of every
lying refuge, and can say,</p>
<blockquote><p>Other refuge have I none;<br />
Hangs my helpless soul on thee!</p>
</blockquote>
<p>Dear Name!&mdash;the rock on which I build.&mdash;To him, with
the Father, and the Spirit, three co-equal Persons in one God, be
glory for ever.&nbsp; AMEN.</p>

1</span>PROOFS<br />
<span class="GutSmall">OF THE</span><br />
Godhead of the Holy Spirit.</h2>
<p style="text-align: center">ADDRESSED TO ALEXANDER.</p>
<p><span class="smcap">Sir</span>,</p>
<p>Since you have mounted the scorner&rsquo;s chair, and set your
tongue against the heavens, by denying the glorious doctrine of
the Godhead, divinity, personality, and of course the offices and
operations of God the eternal Spirit, I consider it my duty to
address you.&nbsp; I once considered you sound in the
faith&mdash;but alas, how have you fallen, and fallen for the
mean the beggarly purpose of a morsel of bread, and your
conscience knows it.&nbsp; I should not perhaps have troubled you
with this letter, but you are so very busy in making converts to
this your opinion&mdash;not contented with going to hell
yourself, you are determined to drag others with you.&nbsp; I
make no apology for this abrupt address, but assure you, that if
you die in these awful sentiments of denying the Godhead,
divinity and distinct personality of the Holy Spirit, your end
will be awful indeed; to treat his sacred person with such awful
contempt is shocking, and to teach others so to do adds to your
crime.</p>
<p>That there is a Holy Spirit you pretend not to deny&mdash;but
&ldquo;What is it?&rdquo; say you and your deluded followers;
&ldquo;O nothing but a <i>mere breath</i>, <i>a point</i>, <i>a
mere emanation</i>, that&rsquo;s all!&rdquo;&nbsp; Pray Sir,
where did you get this information from? not from the Bible that
is plain; where then but from other fools like yourself, and now
imposing these ridiculous notions <a name="page2_2"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 2</span>upon your hearers as if you had been
the original author of them; whereas, yourself can hardly tell
what an emanation means.&nbsp; May the Lord restore you to truth,
or open the eyes of your hearers to see your errors, and your
base design in propagating them.&nbsp; But from the Scriptures of
truth I am about to prove that the adorable Spirit is something
more than a mere breath or an emanation; and that the
ever-blessed Spirit is a person God blessed for
evermore&mdash;and be it at your peril to contradict it.&nbsp;
<i>Deny</i> it you may&mdash;<i>reason</i> about it you
may&mdash;but overthrow it you never shall.&nbsp; Thousands of
hearts, tongues and pens have been employed in this black work
before you was born, who are gone to the judgment seat of God to
answer for this crime; and without you relinquish your notions,
without humbling grace, and the pardon of this sin, so will
you.</p>
<p>To the law and testimony, without one word of reason from me,
let the word speak, and we shall find something more than
emanation.</p>
<p>The adorable Spirit is described as a person; and every one
knows that a person is a <i>living</i>, <i>thinking</i>,
<i>intelligent</i> being, endowed with <i>will</i> and
<i>understanding</i>; and such is the Holy Spirit.</p>
<p>He communicates natural and spiritual life to mankind, he must
therefore possess it himself.</p>
<p>He wills what he pleases, which would be ridiculous to suppose
of an emanation.</p>
<p>He divideth to every man severally as <i>He</i> will.</p>
<p>He knoweth all things, yea, the deep things of God&mdash;this
can never be said of a mere point of light.</p>
<p>Personal actions are ascribed to him in not less than twenty
particulars in the new Testament&mdash;</p>
<p>He shall convince the world of sin; then he must be a person
if he be capable of convincing another of his mistakes, as all
the following actions prove this point.</p>
<p>He teacheth all things; a human teacher is a person, so surely
is a divine one.</p>
<p>He is a comforter&mdash;sheds abroad the love of
God&mdash;takes of <a name="page2_3"></a><span class="pagenum">p.
3</span>the thing, of Christ&mdash;shews them unto
us&mdash;applies the promises&mdash;declares our pardon is the
earnest and seal of a promised heaven&mdash;he is one of the
Three that bears witness in heaven&mdash;testifies of
Christ&mdash;bears witness to the Saints&mdash;acts as a spirit
of grace and supplication&mdash;helps the saints in
prayer&mdash;makes intercession in them&mdash;gives gifts to his
people&mdash;calls, qualifies, orders, commands, and directs his
ministers&mdash;dwells in the saints and will raise their bodies
in the last day.</p>
<p>Now if all these are not personal actions, I leave every
sensible person to judge; surely none but persons destitute of
reason can deny such infallible testimony; besides, love, grief,
being rebelled against, vexed, provoked, lied unto, blasphemed,
sinned against with an unpardonable sin, which can never apply to
a mere breath, a quality, an attribute, or an emanation.&nbsp; I
judge how you, sir, and in general all that have been and now are
in the ditch.&nbsp; Apply these glorious scriptures&mdash;that
they belong to the Father, say some; no, they belong to Christ,
says another; whereas, it is plain that the blessed Spirit is
distinct from both.&nbsp; The Redeemer declares, &ldquo;The Lord
God and his <i>Spirit</i> hath sent me.&rdquo;&nbsp; He is called
the Spirit of his Son&mdash;he is to be sent from the
Father.&nbsp; His work which is set forth in the above-mentioned
texts is distinct from the work of the Father and the Son.&nbsp;
His glorious appearance at the baptism of Christ proves the same
fact; so his name mentioned at the baptism of believers.&nbsp; He
is called Jehovah Lord and God; the incommunicable perfections of
God are in him, and all the glorious works peculiar to God are
said to be done by him.&nbsp; Eternity&mdash;he is the eternal
Spirit&mdash;he is omnipresent, omniscient, and
omnipotent&mdash;he brought creation into order&mdash;gave life
to all&mdash;formed the starry heavens&mdash;made
man&mdash;directs the affairs of providence&mdash;endited the
Bible&mdash;formed the sacred body of Christ&mdash;and at last
raised it from the dead; he is also worshipped with the Father
and the Son, and so must be distinct from both; he is not the
godhead of the Son, because he is distinct from the Son, hence he
is called the Spirit of his Son.</p>
<p><a name="page2_4"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 4</span>A few
more proofs of the dignity, Godhead, and personality of the Holy
Spirit out of a vast abundance I shall here introduce.&nbsp; My
design in this little tract is the glory of the blessed
Spirit&mdash;the establishing and confirming those who are taught
of God&mdash;to put a sword into the hands of the young Christian
to recover backsliders, and to shame those who have apostatized
from their profession of this truth.&nbsp; Oh for a blessing upon
this humble attempt! but this is dependant upon God the Holy
Ghost.</p>
<p>I am not writing a body of divinity.&nbsp; I have not
abilities for that; but only stating those truths which are dear
to my heart, and producing a few out of the many Scriptures, to
prove the Godhead of the Saviour and the ever-blessed Holy
Spirit.&nbsp; A few must suffice here.</p>
<p>John iii. 6.&mdash;&ldquo;That which is born of the
Spirit.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1 John, v. 4.&mdash;&ldquo;Whatsoever is born of
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Here the spiritual birth is attributed to the
<i>Spirit</i>&mdash;to <i>God</i>.</p>
<p>Therefore the Holy Spirit is God.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Acts xiii. 2.&mdash;&ldquo;The Holy Ghost said&mdash;separate
<i>me</i> Barnabas and Saul, for the work whereunto I have called
them.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Heb. v. 4.&mdash;&ldquo;No man taketh this honour to himself,
but he that is called of <i>God</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore the Spirit is God.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Matt. ix. 38.&mdash;&ldquo;Pray ye, therefore, the Lord of the
harvest, that <i>he</i> will send forth labourers into <i>his</i>
harvest.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acts xiii. 4.&mdash;&ldquo;So they being set forth by the Holy
Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This proves the Holy Ghost is the Lord of his harvest.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Luke ii. 16.&mdash;&ldquo;And it was revealed unto him by the
Holy Ghost, that he should not see death before he had seen the
Lord Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verse 28.&mdash;&ldquo;And he blessed God, and said, Lord, now
lettest thou thy servant depart in peace, according to <i>thy
word</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page2_5"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 5</span>This
Word was the Word of the Holy Ghost, and is <i>God</i> and
<i>Lord</i>, to be blessed and praised.</p>
<p>John xiv. 17.&mdash;&ldquo;<i>He</i>, the Spirit of Truth,
dwelleth in you, and shall be in you.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1 Cor. xiv. 25.&mdash;&ldquo;<i>God</i> is in you, of a
truth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2 Tim. iii. 14.&mdash;&ldquo;All Scripture is given by
inspiration of God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2 Peter xxi&mdash;&ldquo;Holy men of old spake as they were
moved by the Holy Ghost.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John iv. 41.&mdash;&ldquo;It is written in the prophets, and
they shall all be taught of <i>God</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1 Cor. ii. 13.&mdash;&ldquo;Not in the word which man&rsquo;s
wisdom teacheth, but which the Holy Ghost teacheth.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acts v. 3.&mdash;&ldquo;Why hath Satan filled thine heart to
lie to the Holy Ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Verse 4.&mdash;&ldquo;Thou hast not lied unto men, but unto
<i>God</i>.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1 Cor. iii. 16.&mdash;&ldquo;The temple of <i>God</i> is holy,
which temple are ye?&rdquo;</p>
<p>1 Cor. vi. 19.&mdash;&ldquo;Know ye not that your bodies are
the temples of the Holy Ghost?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Dent. vi. 14.&mdash;&ldquo;Thou shall not tempt the Lord thy
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Acts v. 9.&mdash;&ldquo;How is it that ye have agreed to tempt
the spirit of the Lord?&rdquo;</p>
<p>Matt. xix. 17.&mdash;&ldquo;There is none good but one, that

<p>Psalm clxxiii. 10.&mdash;&ldquo;Thy Spirit is good; lead

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I might mention many more, with a vast many proofs of this
sublime doctrine, but I trust you will be led to read them in the
Scriptures with a grace-taught eye, and rejoice in the truth as
you discover and feel it.</p>
<p>&ldquo;There are three which bear record in
heaven&rdquo;&mdash;the Father; the Word, (as Son of God) and the
Holy Spirit; and these <i>three</i> are <i>one</i>&mdash;not
merely one person, bearing three <i>names</i>, but three
persons&mdash;nor yet three gods, but only <i>one</i> in
essence&mdash;<i>three</i> in persons, distinct in personality,
names and office.&nbsp; This sacred Three bear record to the
Sonship, Godhead, Divinity, and Dignity of Christ.&nbsp; So they
also bear record to the consciences of God&rsquo;s dear
people&mdash;that they are <a name="page2_6"></a><span
class="pagenum">p. 6</span>the Lord&rsquo;s.&nbsp; The record of
the Father is, &ldquo;Yea, I have loved thee;&rdquo;&mdash;the
record of the Son is, &ldquo;I have redeemed
thee;&rdquo;&mdash;and the record of the Spirit is, &ldquo;I have
called thee.&rdquo;&nbsp; It is necessary this grand point should
be well understood by the Lord&rsquo;s people, that they may
enjoy distinct holy communion with, and give equal glory to, the
adorable Author of Salvation.</p>
<p>It was my lot to fall in with, and to be often situated with
characters who were inimical to this grand fundamental
truth.&nbsp; Swedenborg denied the existence of the Father and
the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Socinians, Arians, and Sabellians, either
in one form or another, deny the Godhead of Christ, and the
personality of the Holy Spirit.&nbsp; Thus, amongst this motley
group, they leave us no God at all.&nbsp; Many have been my
conflicts with such; but the Word is so plain upon the subject,
that it needs no comment, only by comparing a very few out of the
many scriptures of truth, and drawing a very reasonable inference
from the plainest testimony.&nbsp; This has been done by an
excellent author, the rev. W. Jones; and the great Mr. Macgowan,
in his &ldquo;Twenty Letters to J. Priestly, D.D.&rdquo;</p>
<p>I will only compare a few texts together, and you will see the
beauty of truth.&nbsp; As&mdash;</p>
<p>Isaiah vi. 5&mdash;&ldquo;Mine eyes have seen the King, the
Lord of Hosts.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John xii. 41.&mdash;&ldquo;These things said Esias, when he
saw his (Christ&rsquo;s) glory, and spake of him.&rdquo;</p>
<p>&ldquo;Therefore Jesus is the Lord of Hosts.&rdquo;&nbsp;
Isaiah xliii. 11.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Isaiah xliii. 11.&mdash;&ldquo;I, even I, am the Lord, and
besides me there is no Saviour.&rdquo;</p>
<p>2 Peter iii. 18.&mdash;&ldquo;Our Lord and Saviour Jesus
Christ.&rdquo;</p>
<p><i>Then Jesus Christ is Jehovah</i>, <i>the Saviour</i>.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Rev. xxii. 6.&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord God of the Holy Prophets
sent his angel to shew unto his servants things which must
shortly be done.&rdquo;</p>
<p><a name="page2_7"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 7</span>Rev. v.
16.&mdash;&ldquo;I, Jesus, have sent mine angel to testify these
things unto the churches.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore Jesus is the Lord God of the Prophets.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Isaiah xliv. 6.&mdash;&ldquo;Thus saith the Lord, the King of
Israel, and his Redeemer, the Lord of Hosts, I am the first, and
I am the last, and besides me there is no God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rev. xxii. 13.&mdash;&ldquo;I (Jesus) am the Alpha and Omega,
the beginning and the end, the first and the last.&rdquo;</p>
<p>This is too plain to be denied.&nbsp; Christ is the King of
Israel, the Redeemer, the Lord of Hosts, the first and the
last.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Psalm lxxviii. 56.&mdash;&ldquo;They tempted and provoked the
Most High God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>1 Cor. x. 9.&mdash;&ldquo;Neither let us tempt Christ, as some
of them also tempted.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ must be, therefore, the Most High God.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Isaiah xxxvii. 5.&mdash;&ldquo;For thy Maker is thy husband,
the Lord of Hosts is his name.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John iii. 29.&mdash;&ldquo;He that hath the bride is the
bridegroom.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Psalm xxiii.&mdash;&ldquo;The Lord (Jehovah) is my
shepherd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John x. 16.&mdash;&ldquo;There shall be one fold and one
shepherd.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ must be the Lord of Hosts.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>Psalm c. 3.&mdash;&ldquo;Know ye that the Lord he is God, we
are his people, and the sheep of his pasture.&rdquo;</p>
<p>John x. 3.&mdash;&ldquo;He calleth his own sheep.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Therefore, Christ he is the Lord God and shepherd.</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>John xx. 28.&mdash;&ldquo;And Thomas answered and said, my
Lord and my God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Romans ix. 5.&mdash;&ldquo;Of whom, as concerning the flesh,
Christ came; who is over all, God, blessed for ever.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Christ is, therefore Lord and God.</p>
<p><a name="page2_8"></a><span class="pagenum">p. 8</span>Isaiah
ix. 6.&mdash;&ldquo;And his name shall be called The Mighty
God.&rdquo;</p>
<p>Rev. i. 8.&mdash;&ldquo;I am the Almighty.&rdquo;</p>

<div class="gapspace">&nbsp;</div>
<p>I might here fill a volume of immense size, to prove the same
fact; but when God gives a man up to Satanic delusion, he
generally mounts the scorner&rsquo;s chair, sets his tongue
against the heavens, and endeavours to bring down the Almighty to
his proud carnal reasonings.</p>
<blockquote><p style="text-align: center">&ldquo;Thus fools rush
in, where angels fear to tread.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>But,</p>
<blockquote><p>&ldquo;God is a name my soul adores,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Th&rsquo; Almighty Three, th&rsquo; Eternal One:<br
/>
Nature and grace, with all their powers,<br />
&nbsp;&nbsp; Confess the Infinite Unknown.&rdquo;</p>
</blockquote>
<p>&ldquo;Who art one God, one Lord; not one only person, but
three persons in one substance.&nbsp; For that which we believe
of the glory of the Father, the same we believe of the Son, and
of the Holy Ghost, without any difference or inequality.&nbsp;
Therefore, with Angels and Archangels, and with all the company
of heaven, we laud and magnify thy glorious, name; evermore
praising thee, and saying, Holy, holy, holy Lord God of hosts,
heaven and earth are full of thy glory: Glory be to thee, O Lord
most high.&nbsp; Amen.&rdquo;</p>

1.F.

1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg-tm

Project Gutenberg-tm is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.

Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg-tm's
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg-tm collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg-tm and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at
www.gutenberg.org 

Section 3. Information about the Project Gutenberg Literary

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg
Literary Archive Foundation

Project Gutenberg-tm depends upon and cannot survive without wide
spread public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.

The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular
state visit www.gutenberg.org/donate

While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.

International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.

Please check the Project Gutenberg Web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg-tm electronic works.

Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg-tm concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.

Project Gutenberg-tm eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.

Most people start at our Web site which has the main PG search
facility: www.gutenberg.org

This Web site includes information about Project Gutenberg-tm,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
